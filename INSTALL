INSTALLING QTGPSC FROM SOURCE
=============================

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to a new build of qtGpsc, you should
========== uninstall the old one first. Follow the uninstallation instructions
           at the end of this document before continuing.

To build, make sure you have the prerequisites.

- Linux kernel >= 2.6
- CMake >= 2.6
- GCC and make
- Qt >= 4.5 development files and headers
- libgps >= 2.96

openSUSE 11.2 or later users can run this to get the required packages:
  zypper install cmake libqt4-devel libgps19

IMPORTANT: At the time of this writing the latest published gpsd version
========== is 2.95 (published on 2010-07-13) which is *not* compatible
           with this software, as we require libgps API version 5.0 or
           greater.

Once you have the required libraries, you can build and install with:
  cd <qtgpsc_dir>
  ./install.sh

The script will escalate your privileges to root (using "sudo") to complete the
installation. If that makes you nervous, you can do each step manually. Just
take a look at what "install.sh" does and do the same thing at the console.    

INSTALLING QTGPSC FROM PACKAGES
===============================

Binary installation packages for certain Linux distributions are available 
via the openSUSE Build Service (build.opensuse.org). These can be installed
through your distro's native package manager. You can also add our
repositories to be notified about future upgrades. Visit 
http://navlost.eu/devel/qtgpsc for details.

Note that these packages are not "official" packages maintained by the distro
developers. If your distro provides its own packages, you should use those
instead unless you want the absolute latest code.

You can also build the distro packages yourself if you have an account at the
openSUSE Build Service (OBS). To do this, first run the "./obs-staging.sh"
script from the top-level project directory. This will prepare a tarball of
the source code and also generate the meta-package files, all of which are
placed in a subdirectory called "staging". Simply upload the contents of
this directory to OBS or use the command line "osc" tool to build packages
locally. Instructions for OBS are available at http://build.opensuse.org. 

UNINSTALLING QTGPSC
===================

To remove qtGpsc or before upgrading, follow these steps:

1) If you installed directly from sources, run these commands as root:
     cd <qtgpsc_dir>/build
     make uninstall

2) If you installed from a package, remove it via your package manager.
