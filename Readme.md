qtGPSc
===========

[qtGPSc](http://code.google.com/p/qtgpsc/) is originally a simple graphical client for gpsd. However for this project their skyview widget has been extracted into is's own library which is reused in this application.
All credits should go to the original developers, however bugs should initially be filed for VisionSpray for us to check whether we might have introduced those.
